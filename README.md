# GraphExplorer: Advanced Graph Visualization & Pathfinding Tool 🗺️🔍

## Overview
**GraphExplorer** is a powerful Python application designed for interactive graph creation, visualization, and exploration of various pathfinding algorithms.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🌐 **Interactive Graph Building**: Create graphs directly on a map background.
- 🔄 **Multiple Pathfinding Algorithms**:
  - Shortest Path
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - A* Search
- 🎥 **Visual Algorithm Traversal**: Watch the algorithm in action as it traverses the graph.
- 💾 **Graph Persistence**: Save and load graphs for future use.
- 🛠️ **Custom Node and Edge Management**: Add, edit, and remove nodes and edges with ease.

---

## 📦 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python** 3.8 or higher
- Required Python Libraries:
  - `tkinter`
  - `networkx`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pillow`
